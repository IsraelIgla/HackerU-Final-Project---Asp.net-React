            <p><b>NO WARRANTY</b></p>
            <p>While We use our reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the Site, We do not warrant or represent that it will always function or be error-free. We assume no responsibility or liability for errors or omissions on the Site or for problems with its operation. Your access and use of the Site are at your own risk. Without limiting the foregoing, THE SITE, ITS CONTENT AND ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERED THROUGH IT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so the above may not apply to you.</p>
            <p><b>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b></p>
            <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL  {getValueFromDictionary('businessName')}, ITS RELATED COMPANIES, AND EACH SUCH COMPANY'S DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR ACCESS, USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE SITE OR ANY TRANSACTION ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE SITE. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain damages, so the above may not apply to you. If any authority holds any portion of this section to be unenforceable, then liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
            <p>The foregoing limitation of liability is not applicable to residents of New Jersey. With respect to residents of New Jersey,  {getValueFromDictionary('businessName')}, its related companies, and each such company's directors, officers, employees and agent are not liable for any damages unless such damages are the result of our negligent or reckless acts or omissions; and We are not, in any case liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages.</p>
            <p><b>INDEMNITY</b></p>
            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold  {getValueFromDictionary('businessName')} and its related companies and each of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents harmless from and against any third-party claim or cause of action, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, out of your access or use of the Site or your violation of any law or the rights of any person.</p>
            <p><b>BINDING ARBITRATION</b></p>
            <p>You agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Site or use of the Site or these Terms of Use, other than claims relating to infringement of copyright or other intellectual property, may only be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with this arbitration provision or alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The arbitration must be held in a location determined by the arbitrator as set forth herein (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, in accordance with the applicable procedural rules set forth in the then prevailing Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS ("JAMS Rules and Procedures"), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The JAMS Rules and Procedures are available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling <a>(800) 352-5267</a>. The arbitrator must be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator shall apply Missouri law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. If you initiate arbitration against  {getValueFromDictionary('businessName')}, you will not be responsible for professional fees for the arbitrator's services or any other JAMS fees. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be cost-prohibitive or greater than the costs of litigation,  {getValueFromDictionary('businessName')} will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive or more expensive than the cost of litigation. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision remains in effect and must be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision is null and void, and neither you nor  {getValueFromDictionary('businessName')} is entitled to arbitrate their dispute. THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION MUST BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.</p>
            <p>BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO MAINTAIN OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION.</p>
            <p><b>DISPUTES</b></p>
            <p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri, United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any action to enforce these Terms of Use regarding a claim not subject to binding arbitration must be brought in the federal court in the Eastern District of Missouri or the state courts located in St. Louis County, Missouri. By using the Site, you consent to the jurisdiction and venue of these courts. Except where prohibited, you agree that any and all disputes, claims and causes of action directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to the Site must be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action. This limitation does not apply to residents of New Jersey. Any claim or cause of action you may have with respect to the Site must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises, regardless of any law to the contrary. This limitation does not apply to residents of New Jersey.</p>
            <p><b>GENERAL</b></p>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision must be construed consistent with applicable law, and the remaining provisions must be enforced. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope of such section. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other provision. These Terms of Use set forth the entire agreement between you and  {getValueFromDictionary('businessName')} in connection with your use of the Site.</p>
